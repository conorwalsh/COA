COA: Conor's Obscurification Algorithm is a way of obscuring data being sent between an Arduino and a webserver. This is useful as most reversible encryption algorithms wonâ€™t run on Arduino and the very few that do are extremely slow. This algorithm can obscure most data on an Arduino in 100 to 300 milliseconds.

I originally wrote this software as part of an award winning Internet of Things project that I presented at the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition 2015 (Ireland).

Please note that this is not a fully finished piece of software and on some rare occasions artefacts can be left in the decrypted string but this has only happened to me on very rare occasions.

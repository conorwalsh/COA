COA: Conor's Obscurification Algorithm is a way of obscuring data being sent between an Arduino and a webserver. This is useful as most reversible encryption algorithms wonâ€™t run on Arduino and the very few that do are extremely slow. This algorithm can obscure most data on an Arduino in 100 to 300 milliseconds.
